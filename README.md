# sp108e_ws2815

prolly best to start with the config-flow branch, more bang for the buck, will merge when
complete, then hopefully a 'real' integration.

This integration is for the ALITOVE WS2812B WS2811 WS2801 LED WiFi Controller

tested with two controllers so far using a BTF-LIGHTING WS2815 (Upgraded WS2812B) 16.4ft 300
Pixels Magic Dream Color Individually Addressable RGB LED Flexible Strip Light 5050 SMD Dual
Signal IP30 Non-Waterproof DC12V Black PCB

on / off, color and brightness are supported, mono color effects are good,
presets with colors work but ymmv with rgb wiring...

built using https://github.com/home-assistant/example-custom-config/tree/master/custom_components/example_light
and https://github.com/kylezimmerman/pyledshop as a base.

added conifg_flow to support adding devices via the ha ui. host (ip address) and name are required
for each controller.
